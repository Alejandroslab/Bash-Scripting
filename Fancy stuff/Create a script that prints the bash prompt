to print the bash prompt you must use this:

 echo "${PS1@P}"

You can start from this command to write the script 


PROBLEM
the problem is that some bash will not accept this kind of syntax.
Also it seems that you cannot insert the command in a script...

In the script you will get the error 

myscript.sh: 3: Bad substituion

where the number stands for the line in which the command is insert 

It seems that is not possible without xdotools

You may also want to create a script similar to this:

##########
entern () {
      if [ "$1" ]; then
        for i in $(seq 1 $1); do echo "${PS1@P}"; done
      else
        for i in $(seq 1 10); do echo "${PS1@P}"; done
      fi
}
enter 4
#########
